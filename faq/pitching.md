# Pitching Guide

## 🎯 Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

> **M-OBS is the observability stack for Mantle blockchain** - think Datadog meets Etherscan, but specifically built for real-time monitoring. We help developers and node operators detect issues before users do, with instant alerts on transaction failures, RPC provider health, and gas anomalies.

- ❌ No competitive benchmarking against other providers
- ❌ Manual health checks are time-consuming

**For dApp Teams:**
- ❌ Gas spikes catch teams off-guard
- ❌ Transaction failures impact user experience
- ❌ No proactive monitoring system

### Market Size

**Total Addressable Market (TAM):**

## 🎪 Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)

> "Imagine you're running a DeFi protocol on Mantle. A user tweets that transactions are failing. But you had no idea. By the time you check, you've lost users and reputation. This happens all the time.
>
> M-OBS solves this. Let me show you."

### Demo Flow (3 minutes)

**1. Overview Dashboard (30s)**
```
[Show live dashboard]

"This is our real-time dashboard. See these metrics? 
- 500+ transactions monitored
- 100% success rate
- All updated every 2 seconds

Notice these failed transactions from 2 minutes ago? 
We detected them instantly. Not 10 minutes later. Not after users complained. Instantly."
```

**2. Provider Health (45s)**
```
[Navigate to Providers page]

"Here's something unique - RPC provider monitoring.
See these three providers? Two are healthy (99 score), one is down (26 score).

Your users are automatically routed to healthy providers.
And you get instant alerts when a provider degrades.

No more manual checks. No more downtime surprises."
```

**3. Transaction Explorer (45s)**
```
[Navigate to Transactions page]

"Every transaction on your contracts, in one place.
Filter by success/failed. Search by address. Sort by gas.

Click any transaction - you get full details, decoded errors, gas analysis.

Perfect for debugging production issues in real-time."
```

**4. Alerts (30s)**
```
[Show or mention Alerts page]

"And here's the power feature - custom alerts.
- Failure rate spikes above 5%? Alert.
- Gas price jumps 50%? Alert.  
- Provider goes down? Alert.

Slack, Discord, email - your choice. Instant notification."
```

### Closing (30 seconds)

> "That's M-OBS. Real-time visibility. Proactive monitoring. Peace of mind.

## 🔥 Handling Objections

### Objection 1: "Why not just use Etherscan?"

**Response:**
> "Great question. Etherscan is excellent for historical lookup, but it has 10-30 second delays and no alerting. Think of Etherscan as Google Maps after the accident happened. M-OBS is Waze warning you before you hit traffic.
>
> Plus, we monitor your RPC providers - Etherscan doesn't do that at all. And our alerts are fully customizable to your needs."

### Objection 2: "Tenderly already does this."

**Response:**
> "Tenderly is amazing for simulation and debugging, but it's expensive ($500-2,000/month) and generic across all chains. We're laser-focused on Mantle, which means:
> - Mantle-specific optimizations
> - Lower cost ($49-199/month)  
> - Better performance for Mantle dApps
>
> Plus, our provider health monitoring is unique - Tenderly doesn't offer that."

### Objection 3: "We can build this in-house."

**Response:**
> "Absolutely, and many teams try. But here's what we learned building M-OBS:
> - It took 6 hours of focused development, but weeks of production hardening
> - Handling blockchain reorgs is tricky
> - RPC provider failover logic is complex
> - You need 24/7 uptime infrastructure
>
> At $49-199/month, we're cheaper than half a developer's day. Why spend weeks building and maintaining this when you could be building your core product?
>
> Plus, we handle upgrades, scaling, and new features automatically."

### Objection 4: "The market is too small."

**Response:**
> "Mantle is our beachhead, not our endgame. Here's the strategy:
> 1. Prove product-market fit on Mantle (lower competition, growing ecosystem)
> 2. Expand to other L2s (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)
> 3. Build cross-chain monitoring platform
>
> The L2 ecosystem has 100+ projects with $10B+ TVL. Even capturing 1% is a $100M opportunity.
>
> We start focused, then scale."

### Objection 5: "What if Mantle builds this?"

**Response:**
> "Three reasons why we're better positioned:
> 1. **Independence** - We're chain-agnostic. Teams trust us more than chain-specific tools.
> 2. **Speed** - We can iterate faster than core protocol teams (different priorities).
> 3. **Multi-provider** - Chain teams won't monitor competitors. We do.
>
> Plus, if Mantle wants this capability, they're more likely to partner with us than rebuild it. Win-win."
